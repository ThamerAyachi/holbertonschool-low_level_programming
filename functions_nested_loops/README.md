Write a program that computes and prints the sum of all the multiples of `3` or `5` below `1024` (excluded), followed by a new line.                                                                                   |
| 103-fibonacci.c        | Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89. By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed 4,000,000, write a program that finds and prints the sum of the even-valued terms, followed by a new line. |
